1. autodiff faster when there is a summation. typical in ML problem. may not exist in robust PCA. (split cost)

2. special analysis for different example. dictL good, spectral radius med, rpca bad.

3. change input compatible with pytorch tensor

4. MATLAB parfor also parallel executation

5. gpu support for constrained DL

6. consider nonconx rpca, otherwise cannot win cvx

7. Generalized PyTorch function. Not only Built-in

Manuscript:

1. show results consistent with matlab (Rosenbrock, Spectral)

2. Performance analysis: DictL, spectral, rpca (bad)

3. GPU for osqp and autodiff
