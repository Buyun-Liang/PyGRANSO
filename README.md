## General Information

The goals of our high-level project are: 

1) Build scalable and user-friendly numerical optimization packages for solving general nonconvex, nonsmooth, constrained optimization problems. This software package will be distributed and actively maintained for wider community usage. 

2) Perform a computational and theoretical study of constrained deep learning. Current deep learning frameworks, albeit powerful, cannot integrate physical constraints or prior knowledge. This is because the standard software frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch cannot handle constrained problems. The proposed software package will enable a systematic study of the computational and theoretical foundations of constrained deep learning.
