* Tim Mitchell (http://www.timmitchell.com/)
    * Author of GRANSO: GRadient-based Algorithm for Non-Smooth optimization
      (http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/).  

* Buyun Liang (https://buyunliang.org/)
    * Ported GRANSO to Python, thus creating PyGRANSO (https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO)
    * Added built-in support for PyTorch, including:
        * auto-differentiation for computing gradients
        * GPU acceleration
        * tensor input
    * Support for new QP solvers
    * Added many new examples
    * Maintains associate website (https:ncvx.org)
